    "## 1.Why Keras?\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorFlow project has adopted Keras as the high-level API for the TensorFlow 2.0 release.The biggest reasons to use Keras stem from its guiding principles, primarily the one about being user friendly. Beyond ease of learning and ease of model building, Keras offers the advantages of broad adoption, support for a wide range of production deployment options, integration with at least five backend engines (TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano, MXNet, and PlaidML), and strong support for multiple GPUs anddistributed training. Plus, Keras is backed by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Uber, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a lightweight API and rather than providing an implementation of the required mathematical operations needed for deep learning. Itprovides a consistent interface to efficient numerical libraries called backends. Keras does not do its own low-level operations, such as tensor products and convolutions; it relies on a backend engine for that. Even though Keras supports multiple backendengines, its primary (and default) backend is TensorFlow, and its primary supporter is Google. The Keras API comes packaged in TensorFlow as 𝑡𝑓.𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑠, which isthe primary TensorFlow API as of TensorFlow 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following labs, we will mainly use Keras with TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an open source library for fast numerical computing. It was created and is maintained by Google and released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. The API is nominally for the Python programming language,although there is access to the underlying C++ API. Unlike other numerical libraries intended for use in Deep Learning like Theano, TensorFlow was designed for use both in research and development and in production systems, not least RankBrain in Google search and the fun DeepDream project. It can run on single CPU systems, GPUs as well as mobile devices and large-scaledistributed systems of hundreds of machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab PCs have both TensorFlowand Theanoinstalled, you can configure the backend usedby Keras."

    "Load DataWhenever we work with machine learning algorithms that use a stochastic process (e.g. random numbers), as you have been doing this, it is a good idea to initialise the random number generator with a fixed seed value. This is so that you can run the same code again and again and get the same result. This is useful if you need to demonstrate a result, compare algorithms using the same source of randomness or to debug a part of your code. You can initialise the random number generator with any seed you like, for example:\n"

    "\n",
    "Models in Keras are defined as a sequence of layers. We create a 𝑆𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙model and add layers one at a time until we are happy with our network topology. The first thing to get right is to ensure the input layer has the right number of inputs. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the input dim argument and setting it to 8 for the 8 input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know the number of layers to use and their types?This is a very hard question. There are heuristics that we can use and often the best network structure is found through a process of trial and errorexperimentation. Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the structure of the problem if that helps at all. In this example we will use a fully-connected network structure with three layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers are defined using the Denseclass.We can specify the number of neurons in the layer as the first argument and specify the activation function using the 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛argument. We will use the rectifier (𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢) activation function on the first two layers and the sigmoidactivation function in the output layer. It used to be the case that 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑and 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎactivation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is seen using the 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢activation function. We use a 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑activation function on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5. We can piece it all together by adding each layer. The first hidden layer has 12 neurons and expects 8 input variables (e.g. 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑑𝑖𝑚=8). The second hidden layer has 8 neurons and finally the output layer has 1 neuron to predict the class (onset of diabetes or not)."

    "The large amount of data and the complexity of the models require very long training times. As such, it is typical to use a simple separation of data into training and test datasets or training and validation datasets. Keras provides two convenient ways of evaluating your deep learningalgorithms this way:\n",

    "Keras can separate a portion of your training data into a validation dataset and evaluate the performance of your model on that validation dataset each epoch. You can do this by setting the validation split argument on the 𝑓𝑖𝑡()function to a percentage of the size of your training dataset. For example, a reasonable value might be 0.2 or 0.33 for 20% or 33% of your training data held back for validation. The code below demonstrates the use of using an automatic validation dataset on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset."

    "\n",
    "The gold standard for machine learning model evaluation is k-fold cross-validation. It provides a robust estimate of the performance of a model on unseen data. However, cross-validation is often not used for evaluating deep learning models because of the greater computational expense. For example k-fold cross-validation is often used with 5 or 10 folds. As such, 5 or 10 models must be constructed and evaluated, greatly adding to the evaluation time of a model. Nevertheless, when the problem is small enough or if you have sufficient compute \n",
    "resources, k-fold cross-validation can give you a less biased estimate of the performance of your model.\n",

    "The folds are stratified, meaning that the algorithm attempts to balance the number of instances of each class in each fold. The example creates and evaluates 10 models using the 10 splits of the data and collects all of the scores. The verbose output for each epoch is turned off by passing verbose=0 to the 𝑓𝑖𝑡()and 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒()functions on the model. The performance is printed for each model and it is stored. The average and standard deviation of the model performance is then printed at the end of the run to provide a robust estimate of model accuracy."
